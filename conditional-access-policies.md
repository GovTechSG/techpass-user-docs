# Microsoft-Managed Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) in Entra ID

Microsoft has introduced Conditional Access policies (CAPs) that may affect your sign-in experience. These policies enforce additional security checks based on detected risks.

If additional verification is required, you may be asked to:
- Perform multifactor authentication (MFA) again.
- Reauthenticate even if you are already signed in.

This helps protect your account from potential threats.

## What to do if prompted for additional authentication

- Complete the MFA prompt or reauthentication as instructed.
- If you face issues or believe the prompt was triggered incorrectly, contact the Support Team.

Tips to ensure smooth access:
- Keep your authentication methods up to date.
- Use trusted devices and networks where possible.
