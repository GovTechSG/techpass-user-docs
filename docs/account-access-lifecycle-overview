# Account and access lifecycle: Overview

Understanding how user accounts are created, used, and removed is key to managing access securely across Whole-of-Government systems. TechPass acts as a central identity provider, but different stakeholders play important roles at each stage of the account lifecycle.

This section explains how accounts are provisioned, secured, updated, and eventually offboarded â€” and what actions may be required from users, agency admins, service teams, and TechPass.

## Lifecycle stages

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Provisioning** | Accounts are created either through self-sign-up or by invitation, based on the user's role. Access is granted to necessary services and systems. |
| **Usage** | Users authenticate via TechPass to access connected platforms (e.g. SEED, SHIP-HATS, GCC). Identity and device checks may apply. |
| **Change of status** | If a user moves departments or roles, account access may need to be reviewed or adjusted. Internal transfers are not automatically detected. |
| **Deprovisioning** | When a user leaves, their account may be disabled or removed. This affects downstream services like SEED and GCC. |

## Stakeholders involved

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **End user** | Protect your login credentials, approve MFA prompts carefully, and report any anomalies. |
| **Agency (HR, project teams)** | Create or invite users, keep assignments updated, and ensure timely removal upon staff departure. |
| **Service teams** | Define access policies, integrate with TechPass for identity checks, and support access reviews. |
| **IAM provider (TechPass)** | Enforce authentication, device compliance, and lifecycle signals through Entra ID and backend integrations. |
