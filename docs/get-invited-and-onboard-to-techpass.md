# Get invited and onboard to TechPass

This article guides you how to request for a TechPass account and onboard to it. 

?>- Alternatively, public officers with a non-SE GSIB device can access the [**TechBiz Portal**](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg) to request for TechPass and SEED provisioning, which is optional. <br>- For more information, see [**TechBiz documentation**](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/).


## Audience

Users who require a TechPass account but do not have a WOG account or a non-SE GSIB device.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to get invited to TechPass and complete the onboarding:

- Check the flowchart on the [Onboard to TechPass](onboard-to-techpass) page to see if you're eligible to sign up via the Portal. If you can't sign up for TechPass account via TechPass Portal, you need to request to get invited.
- Your organisational email address which has a standard mailbox and not a LiteMail.  
- Before you onboard, ensure you have received the TechPass onboarding email and is still valid.

?>- TechPass does not support email accounts which does not have an inbox. For example, LiteMail accounts. If you use such an email account, upgrade it to a standard mailbox before requesting for TechPass.<br>- If you do not see the TechPass onboarding email in your inbox, please check your Junk Email, Deleted Items or Archive folder.<br>- The onboarding email is valid for 30 days. If you do not onboard to TechPass within this 30 days, we will terminate your TechPass account, and you need to sign up again.
