# Get invited and onboard to TechPass

This article guides you how to request for a TechPass account and onboard to it. 

?>- Alternatively, public officers with a non-SE GSIB device can access the [**TechBiz Portal**](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg) to request for TechPass and SEED provisioning, which is optional. <br>- For more information, see [**TechBiz documentation**](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/).


## Audience

Users who require a TechPass account but do not have a WOG account or a non-SE GSIB device.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to get invited to TechPass and complete the onboarding:

- Check the flowchart on the [Onboard to TechPass](onboard-to-techpass) page to see if you're eligible to sign up via the Portal. If you can't sign up for TechPass account via TechPass Portal, you need to request to get invited.
- Your organisational email address which has a standard mailbox and not a LiteMail.  

?>- TechPass does not support email accounts which does not have an inbox. For example, LiteMail accounts. If you use such an email account, upgrade it to a standard mailbox before requesting for TechPass.


## Step 1: Request for TechPass account

1. Contact your project manager or the reporting officer to request for the provisioning of TechPass and SEED (optional for onshore users, mandatory for offshore users).

   !> To access services such as SGTS and GCC 2.0 resources through an Internet Device, you need to onboard that device to SEED.

2. Project manager or the reporting officer invites you to TechPass.

3. If the invitation is successful, you will receive an email notification containing a link to complete your registration.

  !>- Failure to register within **5 days** invalidates the link and will require a new invitation.

## Step 2: Complete the registration

2. The following information are required:
    - Username
    - First Name
