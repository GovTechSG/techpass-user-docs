## What is TechPass
TechPass is an Identity & Access Management (IAM) and Single Sign On (SSO) Solution for services within the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS).
It is built to provide users with a seamless login experience across SG TechStack services and allow access control to be managed easily from a centralised location.

Head over to our [Getting Started](quickstart) section to find out how you can start using TechPass.

## Key Concepts
TechPass is powered by [Microsoft Azure AD service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/). 
It builds on top of Azure AD to cater to the specific requirements of the public service's development environment. 
TechPass empowers engineering teams working on SGTS products to develop and rollout their services quickly by simplifying the amount of work needed to implement a new service.

TechPass utilises popular open standards such as, [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) / [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) (OpenID Connect) 
and [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html) (Security Assertion Markup Language), 
for authentication and authorization.

OAuth 2.0 setup service is available on TechPass while SAML service is available only by invitation. 
Please reach to us if you need SAML support for your product and services.
