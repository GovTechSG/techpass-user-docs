  By default, your organisational email address will be displayed as username.

  4. Set up an authentication method by choosing one of the following:

  - If you do not have Microsoft Authenticator app(recommended) on your mobile phone, download and install it on your [Microsoft phone](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/store/apps/windows-phone), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en&amp;gl=US) or [iOS phone](https://www.apple.com/app-store/).
  - If you want to use other authenticators, click **I want to use a different authenticator app.**
  - Click **I want to setup a different method.**

  Note: while we recommend Microsoft Authenticator, you can choose any other authenticator app. When you use other authenticators, you may have to enter an OTP to approve your sign in whereas in Microsoft authenticator, you just need to tap **Approve** on your mobile phone.

  As we recommend Microsoft Authenticator, this article guides you to set up multi-factor authentication for your TechPass account using that. For other authenticators, refer to the respective help resources.
