# Reset your TechPass password

This document provides instructions for resetting your TechPass password if your TechPass Login ID's domain is ```techpass.gov.sg.```

!> This article is **not applicable** for users whose TechPass login ID is the same as their organisational email address.


You need to reset your TechPass password:

- If your TechPass account is locked due to multiple unsuccessful login attempts.

- If there is a need to comply with the [Azure Password Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-policy#administrator-password-policy-differences) by resetting the TechPass account password.

?>If you are unable to unlock your account by resetting password, create a [TechPass support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support).


## If you are using a China mobile number

Due to SMS Sender ID restrictions in China, users with China mobile numbers may not receive one-time passwords (OTPs) sent from the `gov.sg` sender. This may prevent you from resetting your password through the usual method.

If you are unable to receive the OTP, follow the steps below for a manual password reset:

1. Create a [TechPass support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support).
2. The support team will reset your password.
3. You will receive a **password-protected ZIP file** containing your new password via email.
4. A **separate email** will be sent to you with the password to unlock the ZIP file.

Ensure that your TechPass username and registered email address are correct when submitting the request.
