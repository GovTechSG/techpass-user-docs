# Reset MFA for WOG account

If your TechPass Login ID is the same as your organisational email address, you have a WOG account and you need to reset your TechPass MFA if you have:

- Changed or lost your mobile phone.
- Deleted the Authenticator app from the mobile phone or unable to access the app on your phone.

## Prerequisites

- You must have your previous mobile phone to authenticate your WOG login.

?> If you have lost or formatted your previous mobile phone or are unable to authenticate using it, contact your Agency Facility Management(AFM) to remove the MFA configured for your WOG profile.
