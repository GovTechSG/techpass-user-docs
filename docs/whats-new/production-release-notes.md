| --- | --- | --- |
| **Change** | Get Existing Users API now checks account existence in the source Entra ID | Previously in **Get Existing Users API**, orphaned accounts that are not found in the source Entra ID (e.g. WoG) were included in the response. We have modified this API to verify the existence of an account in the source Entra ID and exclude it from the response if it is not found. 
| **Change** | New SEED status for TechPass users ineligible for SEED | We've introduced a new **Ineligible** status for users who don't qualify for SEED, such as users with orphaned accounts or accounts from integrated IDPs that don't require SEED (ie.

**29 November 2023**

Frontend version: 1.0.0-20231109.1430 | Backend version: 1.74.5-20231124.1351

| Type      | Change      | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** |  Email broadcast option for Tenants | Tenants can now include individual email addresses when broadcasting emails. Previously limited to techpass groups, this enhancement provides tenants with the ability to specify individual email addresses, extending communication options. <br><br><b>Note</b>: Individual email addresses must be associated with either the WoG or Techpass Identity Provider (IDP) for compatibility.|
| **Change** |Email blast targeting refinement | Upon sending email blasts, the system now filters through request IDs and checks if they match the respective tenant. |
| **Fix** | Automation API: `ListUsers` endpoint in userfilter parameter | This release addresses the issue, ensuring that the ListUsers API now correctly ignores the userfilter parameter. |

**15 November 2023**

Frontend version: 1.0.0-20231102.1605 | Backend version: 1.71.2-20231108.1413

| Type      | Change      | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** |  Automated account termination | We have automated the account termination process for employees who have left the organisation in our [service request form](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support). <br><br><b>Note</b>: Automation applies only to cases initiated by a public officer for another user or when the user themselves terminates their own account, provided the user is not onboarded to SEED.|
| **Enhancement** | Removed unused fields from `List User API` response in Automation API | We have removed unused fields: `lastSignInAt`, `lastInteractiveSignInAt`, `lastNonInteractiveSignInAt`, and `seedDevices`. These fields, which were previously included in the API documentation have been removed to align with the actual response. |
| **Enhancement** | Source application display in Webhooks | Webhooks now display the source application (TechPass or TechBiz), providing clarity to new tenant administrators. |
| **Enhancement** | CAM indicator for Webhook events | A new indicator has been added to highlight CAM required webhook events, specifically for `user-updated` and `user-deleted events`. |
| **Enhancement** | Removed `userType` from Automation API | We have removed the `userType` field from the Automation API payloads. Previously, `userType` was used to denote whether an account was a Guest or Member in Azure AD, causing inaccuracies as public officers were represented as Guests and vendors as Members. To address this, we introduced the `accountType` field, enabling accurate differentiation between public officers, vendors, and temps. With the successful transition of TechPass tenants to use the `accountType` field introduced months ago, we have dropped the `userType` field from our payloads, aligning our system with the enhanced account categorisation. |
| **Fix** | SEED license revocation email issue | We have fixed the issue where SEED license revocation notifications were sent in error to some active SEED users. Please note that this was a false alarm, and no actual licenses were revoked. |

**1 November 2023**

Frontend version: 1.0.0-20231009.1523 | Backend version: 1.69.3-202310230924

Frontend applications can display a countdown or fetch the `cooldown` value from the [Request for OTP](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-otpaas-api/) API for customization.
| **Fix** | Resolved issue with `GetUser` endpoint returning incorrect 404 errors for IDP errors | We have fixed a bug where the `GetUser` endpoint was returning a misleading 404 error for all IDP (Identity Provider) errors. The application code has been revised to accurately reflect the specific errors from Azure. |

## October 2023

**18 October 2023**

Frontend version: 1.0.0-20231009.1523 | Backend version: 1.69.0-20231012.1057

| Type      | Change      | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | Check existing users on Automation API | With the launch of CAM on 23 October 2023, the new [Get Existing Users API](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-automation-api/#tag/User/paths/~1iam~1existing-users/post) facilitates a one-off event where tenants can clean up their local user store by removing accounts that no longer exist in TechPass AAD. This step is vital before integration with TechPass for CAM compliance. After integration, tenants will receive new user terminated webhook events.|
| **Enhancement** | Verify user existence in WoG AAD for invite public officer API  | We have enhanced our `invite public officer` API by verifying user existence in WoG AAD when the provided email belongs to a WoG email domain. TechPass account will not be created if user does not exist in WoG AAD. However to prevent User Enumeration attack, TechPass portal's Self Sign-Up page will always return success, while the Automation API returns a generic error. <br><br>**Note**: For MoE AAD users, TechPass account will always be created as we are not able to verify user existence in MoE AAD. |
| **Enhancement** | New tenant flag - acknowledgeComplianceFlag  | Tenants now have the option to indicate whether they maintain their own user directory. Tenants managing their directories must subscribe to our `user-updated` and `user-deleted` webhooks. |
| **Change** | Deprecation of *LoadMore* query parameter in Automation API| The *LoadMore* feature has been removed from Automation API. Refer to [Deprecation of LoadMore](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-tenant-guide/concepts/deprecation/deprecate-loadmore) for more details.|
| **Fix** | Request timeout with `get user` Automation API (lastSignIn=true) | We have fixed the bug that cause timeouts in the `get user` Automation API, specifically when querying last sign-in information. To address this, we have implemented an interim fix. It sets a time limit for pulling Azure logs; if no results are obtained within the specified timeframe, the system treats it as a no sign-in event. This serves as a temporary solution while we explore a more comprehensive and permanent fix. |

**4 October 2023**

Frontend version: 1.0.0-20230921.1438 | Backend version: 1.69.0-20230922.1123

| **Feature** | Enhanced *user-updated* webhook to include profile changes | We have enhanced the *user-updated* webhook to include profile changes. Previously, the *user-updated* webhook was only triggered when a user's status changed. Now, in addition to status changes, tenants will be notified if other profile fields have been changed. |
| **Fix** | Error after patching user with empty department field | We have fixed the bug that caused an error when patching a user with an empty department field. |

| **Change** | Separation of user and product accounts | We have separated *user* and *product* accounts. Within the new UI, there are now distinct tabs for *user account* and *product account* types. To align our automation API with this change, we have updated it to provide user and product account types via separate API calls.|

| **Enhancement** | Enhancement to SEED device onboarding Status for Public officers | Previously, Public Officers would only see their device status as ‚Äòpending‚Äô until it was fully onboarded. We have now introduced more granular status updates, including 'triggered, waiting for software installation', 'software installed, awaiting backend onboarding', and 'failed'. This offers user greater visibility into the onboarding process. Additionally, we've added a **retry** button to enable users to restart the onboarding process should it fail under certain circumstances. <br/><br/> **Note**: This change only affects Public officers. Vendors currently do not trigger onboarding through the TechPass Portal and do not have a **pending** device. |
| **Enhancement** | Changes to <i>ListGroups</i> Automation API: TechBiz managed groups excluded by default | Groups managed by TechBiz are now excluded from <i>ListGroups</i> on Automation API by default. To include them, you will need to pass the query parameter <i>includeOnTechBiz=true</i>. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature** | TechPass tenant notification for group limit | Tenants will now receive email notifications when their tenant's group count is close to the limit. This notification provides tenants with sufficient notice so that they can request an increase in their group limit without disrupting their service continuity. |
| **Feature** | Webhook failure notification and reminder for tenant admins | Tenant admins will receive an email notification when an invoked webhook endpoint fails and a reminder when there are incomplete cases. This notification and reminder will provide admins with timely information regarding the status of their webhook endpoints and incomplete cases without overwhelming them with excessive notifications. |
| **Enhancement** | Automation API now supports filtering users by account type | We have enhanced the Automation API that enables developers to filter users by account type. This feature will enable developers to easily retrieve a list of users that meet specific account type criteria. |
| **Enhancement** | Company field is now auto-populated based on vendor's email domain when inviting user to TechPass | Previously, users had to manually enter the vendor's company name during the invite flow, which led to inconsistency issues. Now, we've implemented auto-population of the company field based on the vendor's email domain to ensure consistency. |
| **Fix** | Fix for occasional failure in Automation API <i>Get User Info</i> with <i>lastSignIn=true </i> | We have released a fix for an occasional failure observed in the Automation API *Get User Info* endpoint when calling with *lastSignIn=true*. <br/><br/>Previously, TechPass had added an extra step to improve the accuracy of user's last sign-in information by calling *ListSignIns. However, in certain cases, *ListSignIns* would take too long to respond, resulting in a timeout and failed API calls. <br/><br/>To address this issue, TechPass has released a fix that removes the extra step for improved accuracy and implements a best effort approach to avoid failures due to timeouts. This means that while the accuracy of the data may be slightly affected, developers can rely on the API to provide consistent results without any failures.

| **Feature** | Search bar added on TechPass Portal | We have updated TechPass Portal with a new search bar feature that allows users to search for specific applications. Additionally, tenants can also use the search bar to search for applications and OTP Credentials. |
| **Enhancement** | Updated tenants' restriction on TechBiz application role assignment & groups management in TechPass | Previously, if a tenant had onboarded to TechBiz, they were not allowed to manage the app role assignments for any of their applications on TechPass at a tenant-wide level. The restriction is applied to all applications under that tenant. However, we understand that some applications may not be onboarded to TechBiz, and tenants will still need to manage the app role assignments for those applications on TechPass. <br/><br/>To address this, we updated the restriction to be applied at the application level instead of the tenant level. This means that on TechPass, Tenants cannot manage the app role assignments for applications that are onboarded to TechBiz, but they will still be able to manage the app role assignments for applications that are not onboarded to TechBiz.<br/><br/>For applications that are onboarded to TechBiz, the agencies themselves will manage the applications will manage the app role assignments on TechBiz.<br/><br/>Additionally, TechBiz-created groups will no longer be displayed on the TechPass Portal, and tenants will not be able to call certain Automation APIs for these groups. To help tenants exclude TechBiz-created groups from their results, we have introduced a new *excludeOnTechBiz* query parameter for the **List Groups** Automation API. These changes are designed to streamline the management of application role assignments and groups for TechPass tenants. |
| **Enhancement** | Enhanced webhook UI and retry mechanisms | We have implemented a response message when the action button is clicked. Additionally, we have disabled the action button when the webhook status is disabled or the webhook URL is invalid.<br/><br/>In response to user feedback, you can now use the **Retry** action for webhooks with **completed** and **expired** statuses to make it easier for users to reattempt webhook delivery. |
| **Enhancement** | Improve accuracy of user's last sign-in information for Automation API Get User Info <i>with lastSignIn=true</i> | We identified an issue where user's last sign-in information may not have up-to-date information. To address this, we have pulled the last sign-in information from other sources to improve the accuracy. |

| **Fix** | Temps staff account tagging | When agencies invite their temporary staff to use TechPass, their account type will now be tagged as *Temp*. This allows for easy identification of temporary staff accounts by respective tenant admins, who can view this detail on the TechPass Portal.

| **Enhancement** | Email reminders for expiring/expired secrets and certificates | A new cron job sends email reminders to all Tenant admins whenever an application's certificate or secret is going to expire or if expired already. This email will prompt tenant admins to upload new certificate or create a new secret for the application. </br></br> You will have up to 30 days to upload a new certificate or generate a new secret upon receiving such emails. Do this on time for your published applications; otherwise users of this application will have issues in accessing it. |
| **Fix** | Implicit grant settings were overwritten when updating other application settings. | A fix has been applied so that if a Tenant Admin enables the ID Token in the **Implicit Grant settings** via Azure Portal and proceeds to change any application settings in the TechPass Portal, the changes in the Azure Portal will be discarded. |
| **Fix** | Email notification sent to deleted account indicate five days of no sign-in but it should be 30 days . | A fix has been applied to the email template to indicate 30 days instead of 5 days of no sign-in. It was only a typo, the logic for the deletion is triggered after 30 days, as intended. |
| **Fix** | Invite and Get user APIs does not return any value for UserPrincipalName. | On rare occasions, Azure may take up more time than expected to generate a user resource when invite user API is triggered.
